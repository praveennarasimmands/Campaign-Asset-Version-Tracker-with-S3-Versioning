# **Campaign Asset Version Tracker with S3 Versioning**

## **Domain**: Marketing & Advertising

### **Problem Statement**
Marketing teams frequently update creatives, ad copy, and multimedia content during a campaign. Without a proper version control system, managing multiple versions can be error-prone and time-consuming, increasing the risk of using outdated or incorrect assets.

### **Challenges**
- **Multiple Versions of Creative Assets**: Different versions of images, videos, and copy can get mixed up, leading to confusion and inconsistent marketing campaigns.
- **Difficulty in Ensuring the Correct Version is Used**: Teams may inadvertently use outdated assets or forget which version is the latest.
- **Risk of Overwriting Important Assets**: Without version control, marketing teams might overwrite important files, losing access to previous versions or iterations.

### **Solution Overview**
By leveraging **S3 Versioning**, marketing teams can store and manage campaign assets in a version-controlled environment. This ensures that every version of the asset is tracked, and the team can easily access, compare, and revert to any previous version of creative content.

### **How It Solves the Problem**
S3 Versioning provides a complete history of asset changes, making it simple for marketing teams to track edits and updates, retrieve the correct version when needed, and ensure the latest versions are always in use.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning for Campaign Assets**: Store all campaign assets (images, videos, copy, etc.) in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, which automatically tracks all changes.
2. **Develop Tools for Version Tracking**: Build an interface that allows marketing teams to track and compare different versions of creative assets, ensuring the right one is selected for use.
3. **Metadata Tracking**: Track essential metadata, including asset creation date, author, version number, and editorial changes, for better version control and traceability.

---

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Marketing Materials**: Every update to campaign assets (images, videos, copy) is tracked as a new version, making it easy to retrieve past versions.
- **Metadata Tracking**: Capture essential metadata for each asset, such as the creation date, editor, and version number, ensuring traceability.
- **Comparison Tools for Creatives and Campaigns**: Provide tools to compare different versions of campaign assets (e.g., images, videos) to see how they evolved over time.

## **How It Works**

1. **Store Assets in S3**: Upload marketing campaign assets to an S3 bucket with versioning enabled. Each time a change is made to an asset (e.g., a new version of an image or video), a new version is created.
2. **Track Changes**: Each update to assets is automatically tracked and stored as a new version, allowing for easy rollback or review of previous versions.
3. **Compare and Review Versions**: Provide a web interface that allows users to compare versions of assets, check for any differences, and ensure the right assets are used for campaigns.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/campaign-asset-version-tracker.git
cd campaign-asset-version-tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Enable S3 Versioning**

Enable versioning for the S3 bucket that will store the campaign assets. You can use the `enable_versioning.py` script to set up versioning.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 3: Upload Campaign Assets**

Upload new creative assets (e.g., images, videos, copy) using the `upload_asset.py` script, which stores them in the S3 bucket and creates new versions.

```bash
python upload_asset.py
```

### **Step 4: List Available Versions**

Use the `list_versions.py` script to view different versions of a campaign asset.

```bash
python list_versions.py
```

### **Step 5: Compare Asset Versions**

The `compare_versions.py` script allows users to compare two different versions of a creative asset.

```bash
python compare_versions.py
```

## **Versioning Pipeline Development**

1. **Versioning Automation**: Ensure that every time a campaign asset is updated, it creates a new version in the S3 bucket, maintaining a full version history.
2. **Metadata Tracking**: Each version will have associated metadata, such as creation date, editor, and asset type, allowing users to track the evolution of campaign assets over time.
3. **Version Comparison**: Develop a user-friendly interface to easily compare different asset versions and determine which one should be used in the campaign.

**Collaborating with Praveen**: For further development and integration of the versioning pipeline, you can collaborate with Praveen to refine technical requirements and ensure smooth integration.

## **Further Improvements**
- **Integration with Project Management Tools**: Sync the asset versioning system with project management tools like Jira or Asana to track asset approvals and campaigns in real time.
- **Real-Time Version Updates**: Automatically update the campaign assets in real-time during campaign execution to ensure the latest versions are always available.
- **AI-Based Asset Suggestions**: Implement AI algorithms that suggest the most relevant versions of assets based on campaign goals or performance data.

## **Conclusion**
The **Campaign Asset Version Tracker with S3 Versioning** ensures that marketing teams have full control over their creative assets, reducing errors, improving workflows, and ensuring the right versions are always used during campaigns.
